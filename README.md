  ## Description
 This application allows the user to input the type of burger they might want to see on the BURGERS BURGERS BURGERS menu.  They are given the option of devouring the burger which then places the burger in the devoured column.  They are then given the option of deleleting the burger or placing it back in its original location which allows it to be devoured as many times as the user chooses.  So fun.
